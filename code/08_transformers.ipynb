    "## Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're reading a book, and while reading a sentence, you remember something related from a few pages back. This connection helps you better understand the current sentence. A transformer does something similar but for machines. It's a method that helps machines pay \"attention\" to different parts of data (like words in a sentence) to understand it better. It can look at all words at once and decide which ones are important in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the sentence \"He dropped the glass because it was too hot,\" understanding \"hot\" helps us know why the glass was dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT is like a super-smart student. Before giving it any specific task, it reads (or \"trains\" on) a huge amount of text from the internet. This is the \"pre-trained\" part. It learns language, facts, reasoning abilities, and even some mistakes from this data. Then, when you give it a specific question or task, it uses all that knowledge to generate (or \"write\") a coherent and contextually relevant response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Key Topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attention**: This is like the spotlight of our memory. When we think or read, we don't give equal importance to everything. Some parts get more focus because they're more relevant at the moment. In transformers, \"attention\" helps the model decide which parts of the data to focus on more.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embeddings**: Think of this as translating words into a secret language that computers understand better. This language is in the form of numbers. So, \"cat\" might be translated to a list of numbers, which captures the essence or meaning of \"cat\" in this numeric form.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fine-tuning**: Remember our super-smart student, GPT? After it learns from the internet, it can be given specific examples to make it even better at certain tasks. This process is like giving it extra classes on a particular subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Self-Attention**: This is a special feature of transformers. When trying to understand a word, the model looks at all other words in the sentence, not just neighboring words. It's like reading a whole paragraph to understand a single complex word in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Layers**: Transformers have multiple layers, just like how a complex thought might be built on simpler ideas. Each layer in a transformer captures different levels of understanding from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Tokens**: These are chunks of text the model looks at. A token can be as short as one character or as long as one word.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, transformers, like GPT, are advanced tools that help machines understand and generate human-like text by focusing on the right parts of data, remembering what they've learned, and building complex understanding layer by layer."

    "Embeddings are a fundamental concept in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. They provide a way to represent words (or other entities) as dense vectors of real numbers. The idea is to represent semantic meaning in a continuous vector space, where the distance and direction between vectors correspond to semantic differences between the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Natural language has a vast vocabulary. One-hot encoding words would result in extremely high-dimensional vectors with a dimension equal to the vocabulary size. Embeddings reduce this to a manageable size (e.g., 50, 100, 300 dimensions).\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Semantic Relationships**: Good embeddings capture semantic relationships. For instance, the vector difference between \"king\" and \"man\" might be similar to the difference between \"queen\" and \"woman\".\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained embeddings can be used in new tasks, allowing models to benefit from knowledge captured in the embeddings without requiring extensive training data for the new task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are they derived?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various methods to derive word embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Word2Vec**: Uses a shallow neural network to either predict a word given its context (Skip-Gram) or predict the context given a word (CBOW). The weights of this model then serve as the word embeddings.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)**: Constructs a co-occurrence matrix from a corpus and then factorizes this matrix to produce embeddings.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **FastText**: An extension of Word2Vec, it treats each word as composed of character n-grams. This allows it to generate embeddings for out-of-vocabulary words.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Embeddings from Deep Learning Models**: Models like ELMo, BERT, and GPT generate contextual embeddings where the embedding for a word is based on its context in a sentence, and not just the word itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Example with Word2Vec:\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the `gensim` library to demonstrate Word2Vec. Let's create a simple model using some sentences.\n",

    "### Meaning of Q, K, and V:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query (Q)**: Represents the current word for which we want to determine attention scores. It's like asking: \"For this word, how much should I attend to other words in the sequence?\"\n",

The intuition is that not all parts of the input sequence are equally relevant for a given output. Attention provides a weighted sum of the input sequence based on their relevance.\n",

    "### How Attention Scores are Computed\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mechanism in transformers is based on the concept of **queries**, **keys**, and **values**. Each word in our input sequence (like our sentence \"The cat sat on the mat.\") gets transformed into these three representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding**: First, each word in the sentence is transformed into an embedding (a dense vector representation).\n",
    "2. **Compute Q, K, V**: The embeddings are then transformed into query (Q), key (K), and value (V) representations using separate weight matrices for each transformation.\n",
    "3. **Calculate Attention Scores**: For a particular word (like \"sat\"), its query representation (Q) is used to calculate scores with all the key representations (K) of the other words in the sentence. This is usually done using a dot product.\n",
    "4. **Softmax**: The raw attention scores from the previous step are then passed through a softmax function to make them sum up to 1.\n",
    "5. **Compute Output**: The softmaxed attention scores are used to take a weighted sum of the value (V) representations. This gives the output representation for the word \"sat\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, let's take a toy example. Imagine each word's embedding is a 2-dimensional vector, and our Q, K, V transformations are just 2x2 matrices. Let's compute attention scores for the word \"sat\" in our sentence.\n",

   "source": [
    "Let's break down the basics of how GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models work. We'll do this in a step-by-step fashion, starting from the fundamental building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of GPT is the Transformer architecture, which was introduced in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. The key innovation of the Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence relative to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Self-Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind the self-attention mechanism is to compute a weighted sum of all words in a sequence based on their relevance to the current word. This is done by calculating three vectors for each word:\n",
    "- **Query (Q)**: Represents the current word.\n",
    "- **Key (K)**: Represents all the other words.\n",
    "- **Value (V)**: The actual values we want to sum up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weight for each word is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left( \\frac{Q \\cdot K^T}{\\sqrt{d}} \\right) \\cdot V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\(d\\) is the dimension of the query/key vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the Transformer uses not just one set of Q, K, V matrices, but several. This allows the model to capture different types of relationships in the data. Each set of Q, K, V matrices is referred to as a \"head\", and the Transformer uses multiple heads in what's called \"multi-head attention\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Positional Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Transformer does not have any inherent notion of the order of words, it uses positional encodings to give the model information about the position of words in a sequence. These encodings are added to the word embeddings at the input layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. GPT Specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Masked Self-Attention**: While the original Transformer model is bidirectional (it looks at past and future words), GPT only looks at the past. This is done by masking future words in the self-attention mechanism.\n",
    "- **Stacked Layers**: Like other deep learning models, GPT stacks multiple layers of these Transformer blocks to capture more complex patterns.\n",
    "- **Fine-tuning for Tasks**: GPT can be fine-tuned for specific tasks by adding a simple output layer and training on task-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's code a **very simplified** version of the self-attention mechanism to give you an idea of how it works in practice. Note that this will be a highly simplified example and won't capture the full complexity of GPT."

    "## Appendix: Padding & Truncation\n",
    "\n",
    "Both \"padding\" and \"truncation\" are techniques used in the preprocessing of sequences (like sentences or paragraphs) before feeding them to models like transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a tray of cupcake slots, but not all slots are filled with cupcakes. To make every slot look occupied, you might place empty cupcake liners in the empty slots. Similarly, in the world of sequence models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Padding** refers to adding \"dummy\" or \"filler\" values to a sequence to make it reach a certain desired length.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our model expects sequences of length 5 and we have the sentence \"I love cats\", which has only 3 words, we might \"pad\" it with two extra \"dummy\" words to make its length 5: \"I love cats [PAD] [PAD]\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truncation:\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, imagine you have too many cupcakes for the tray. You might have to remove a few to make them fit. Similarly, in sequence processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Truncation** refers to shortening a sequence by removing some of its elements to ensure it doesn't exceed a certain length.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if our model can handle sequences of a maximum length of 5 and we have the sentence \"I really really love cats\", we might \"truncate\" it to fit the model: \"I really really love\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are these important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers, and many other neural network architectures, often expect input sequences of a fixed size. However, in real-world data, sentences and paragraphs can vary widely in length. Padding and truncation help standardize the lengths of these sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Padding** ensures shorter sequences can fit the expected input size.\n",
    "2. **Truncation** ensures longer sequences don't exceed the model's capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's worth noting that truncation can lead to loss of information if not done carefully. Similarly, excessive padding can sometimes reduce the efficiency of the model's training."

    "## Appendix: Bert Model\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is one of the most influential models in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Let's unpack its name and relevance in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "### BERT Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bidirectional**: Traditional language models used to read text either from left to right or right to left. But when we humans read to understand something, we consider the whole context, looking at words both before and after a given word. BERT does the same; it reads text both ways (bidirectionally) to understand the context better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encoder Representations**: BERT is designed to \"encode\" or convert text into a form (like vectors) that machines can understand. By \"representations,\" we mean the machine-friendly format that still captures the essence and meaning of the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transformers**: BERT is built on the transformer architecture, which we discussed earlier. It uses the self-attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence relative to a given word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance of BERT:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-training on Large Data**: BERT is trained on massive amounts of text, like the entire Wikipedia. This gives it a broad understanding of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fine-tuning on Specific Tasks**: Once pre-trained, BERT can be \"fine-tuned\" on a smaller, specific dataset for tasks like question-answering, sentiment analysis, or text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: When introduced, BERT achieved state-of-the-art results on various NLP benchmarks, making it a go-to model for many NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Versatility**: BERT can be adapted to a wide range of NLP tasks with only minimal changes to the model. You essentially add a small layer on top for your specific task and fine-tune BERT on task-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Variants and Offshoots**: BERT's success led to the development of various versions and offshoots tailored for different needs, such as DistilBERT (a smaller, faster version) and RoBERTa (optimized with more data and training tweaks).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, BERT revolutionized NLP by providing a robust and versatile model that understands context better than previous models. Its introduction marked a significant shift in how researchers and practitioners approached NLP tasks, leading to the rapid development and adoption of transformer-based models in various applications."
