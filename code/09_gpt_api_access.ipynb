      "Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) is a method used in option pricing to estimate the expected payoff of an option. This method is particularly useful for pricing American options, which can be exercised at any time before expiration, making them more complex to price than European options, which can only be exercised at expiration.\n",

This is done by fitting a polynomial function to the simulated payoffs using least-squares regression, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the actual and estimated payoffs.\n",

      "Deep Q-learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a neural network to approximate the Q-value function. The Q-value function is used to determine the quality of an action in a given state, which is crucial for the agent to learn the optimal policy.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Exploration vs Exploitation Dilemma**: The agent needs to balance between exploring new actions and exploiting the actions that are known to yield good rewards. If the agent only exploits, it might miss out on potentially better actions. If it only explores, it might not make the best decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sparse Rewards**: In TicTacToe, the agent only gets a reward when it wins or loses the game. This can make it difficult for the agent to understand which actions were beneficial or detrimental.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Delayed Rewards**: The impact of an action in TicTacToe is not immediately apparent and can only be determined at the end of the game. This makes it hard for the agent to associate the reward with the correct action.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **State Representation**: The state of the game in TicTacToe is discrete and not continuous. This can make it difficult for the neural network to generalize from one state to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Overfitting**: Deep Q-learning can easily overfit to the training data, meaning it might not generalize well to new, unseen states.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Non-Stationarity**: The Q-values are constantly changing during the training process, which can make the learning process unstable.\n",
